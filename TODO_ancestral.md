TODO:

 * [ ] include ancestral estimation methods and models (mvMORPH::ancestral) in a dispRity::multi.ace architecture style
 * [ ] store ancestral estimates in a treats format recyclable by other methods
 * [ ] create a general use.treats.method for data with ancestral estimates (using sampling).
   - [ ] easy: plotting
   - [ ] medium: dispRity
   - [ ] harder: generalisable (see whale paper from Natalie for methods examples)
